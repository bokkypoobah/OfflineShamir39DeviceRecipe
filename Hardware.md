# Read-Only Offline Crypto Device Recipe - Hardware

You will need the following items:

### Raspberry Pi 400
The [Raspberry Pi 400](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400-unit/) is a compact self-contained computer built into a keyboard.

<br />

### MicroSD Card

8GB or larger MicroSD card to store the operating system files. I am using a SanDisk Extreme 32GB - see [here](https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/raspberry-pi-microsd-cards) and
[here](https://www.xda-developers.com/best-sd-cards-raspberry-pi/) for some comparisons of these cards.

<br />

### USB-C Power Supply

[Raspberry Pi 15W USB-C Power Supply](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/type-c-power-supply/). Many USB-C laptop power supplies should also work with the Raspberry Pi 400.

<br />

### USB-A or USB-C Mouse

[Raspberry Pi Mouse](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-mouse/), or **USB-A** or **USB-C** equivalent.

<br />

### Monitor With Micro HDMI Cable

Computer monitor connected via a HDMI cable that plugs into one of the two Raspberry Pi 400 **Micro HDMI** ports:

If you have access to computer monitors with only HDMI plugs, you may want to consider something like a [Micro HDMI to HDMI Adapter for Raspberry Pi 4](https://raspberry.piaustralia.com.au/products/micro-hdmi-to-hdmi-adapter-for-raspberry-pi-4):
