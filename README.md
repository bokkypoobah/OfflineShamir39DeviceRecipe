# Offline Shamir39 Device Recipe
Recipe to create an offline device to split and combine BIP39 Mnemonics using Shamir39.

Useful for splitting and combining the mnemonic secret phrase generated by your hardware wallet

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

<br />

## Aims

* Create a device that does not store any information in permanent storage
  * When completed, this setup allows the Raspberry OS to execute with the MicroSD storage device in read-only mode
* Create a device cheap enough that it can be dedicated for a single use and kept permanently offline
* Create a device out of easily obtainable hardware and software
* Document this process, and make it easily reproducible

<br />

## Risks

* Shamir39 tool could have some weaknesses in the algorithms, or in the implementation of the algorithms

<br />

## Hardware

* Raspberry Pi model 2 or above should work. See [Raspberry Pi - Series And Generations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Raspberry_Pi)
* Micro SD card, 4GB or larger
* Power Supply 
* Monitor and HDMI cable
* Mouse and Keyboard

For this exercise, I'm using an [Raspberry Pi 400](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400/)
> featuring a quad-core 64-bit processor, 4GB of RAM, wireless networking, dual-display output, and 4K video playback, as well as a 40-pin GPIO header

<br />

For storage, I'm using a 8GB Micro SD card. You may be able to fit the Raspberry Pi OS image on a 2GB Micro SD card.

<br />

## Sofware

* Raspberry Pi Operating System - https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/
  * Raspberry Pi OS with desktop 1,158MB
  * Raspberry Pi OS with desktop and recommended software 2,678MB

<br />

## Steps

* Assemble hardware
* Download and install the OS on the MicroSD card
* Insert MicroSD card into the RPi and boot
* Connect to network and download https://github.com/iancoleman/shamir39/raw/b12d58d6d71a4db71ac9796e7d82c0a7691dd973/standalone.html (right click save link as)
* Configure the OS for read-only mode and restart

<br />

## Notes

* Disable Bluetooth, WiFi. Tape over network port after setup completed.
* No standard for using Shamirs Secret Sharing with BIP-39 mnemonics. Make sure the same Shamir39 tool is available when required
* Trezor have an alternative Shamir
